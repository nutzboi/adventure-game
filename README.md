# DECI-L2 2023 Final Project
This is a CLI non-graphical adventure game written in python for the DECI-L2 ([Digital Egypt Cubs Initiative](https://www.deci.gov.eg/) - Level 2).
The format of the code follows the PEP8 guidelines (mostly by using [autopep8](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.autopep8) and splitting long lines) as required by the project rubric.
